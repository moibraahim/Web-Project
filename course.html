<h1>Algorithms and Data structures(CS213) :</h1>
<p>In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

<h1>Lecture 1: Why do we need to learn data structures?</h1><br>
<p>By studying data structures, you will understand their strength and weaknesses and will be able to reason about the data structure's applicability for different tasks. You will learn about useful data structures, such as: Heaps — for use cases when you require computation on objects having minimum (or maximum) values.</p>
